DatePicker- Used to handle date selection on the front-end.
Flask REST API- This was used for making requests to the backend API.

Back-end packages used:
Flask-Security - for authentication - tokens, password hashing and user session management 
Flask Cors- This was used to allow resource sharing between the back-end and the front-end since they were on two different servers.
